This the Data Analysis Project I submitted for the final assesment of The IBM Data Analysis course I took up in Coursera.

Popular libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas in Pyton was used in coding the project.

I am making this available online to help people interested with Data Analysis get an intuition about the codes used.

I am hoping this will be helpful to ones who go through the codes and find the the significance of each code used to design the solution.
